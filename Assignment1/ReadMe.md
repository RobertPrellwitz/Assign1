Assignment1.jar is a runnable version

data files are in data folder
To open File with the application you need to access the data directory in the file name.
ex.  data/table.txt

I have tested with multiple files:

badSample.txt -- this file does not conform to the data format  
emptySample.txt - this is an empty file   
REP Sample.txt - this is a tab delimited text file I created with data gaps   
table.txt - Professor provided tab delimted file
